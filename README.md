 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Mihalis Karapiperakis Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a 12-year-old wondering how my favorite video games were made. I taught myself Python, making small games that I shared with family and friends. My love for coding only grew stronger as time passed, and eventually I started making small games with Unity and C#, dreaming to one day release my own video game, something that has yet to come true. Eventually, I finished school and now I am studying Computer Science at the University of Crete. My love for coding isn't limited to just game development anymore, but to software development in general, since I enjoy fixing problems using code  and turning my ideas into reality. This summer, I managed to land a job as an IT technician at IserveU, a company that provides ordering systems. From this job I have learned a lot about computer networks and enterprise system,s something that has interested me for a while. On the other hand, to fulfill my love for coding, I landed a research internship at the Human Centered Computer Vision (HCCV) team at the Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas (FORTH), an opportunity I owe to one of my professors, which deepened my understanding of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Today, I’m eager to tackle real‑world problems through software, contribute to open‑source projects, and continue growing as a developer, whether that’s shipping games, building tools, or exploring the next big idea.
